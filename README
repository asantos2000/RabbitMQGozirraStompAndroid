# Welcome to the RabbitMQGozirraStompAndroid wiki!

It's another Android Chat Application using STOMP protocol.

### Gozirra - [http://www.germane-software.com/software/Java/Gozirra/](http://www.germane-software.com/software/Java/Gozirra/)
Gozirra is a lightweight implementation of the Stomp specification. As of the first release it includes both client and server implementations for Java.

### RabbitMQ Web Stomp - [http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/05/14/introducing-rabbitmq-web-stomp/](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/05/14/introducing-rabbitmq-web-stomp/)
It is basically a bridge between RabbitMQ-STOMP plugin and a Websockets server (SockJS). Hopefully, it is a decent solution for a set of rabbit-on-the-web use cases.
